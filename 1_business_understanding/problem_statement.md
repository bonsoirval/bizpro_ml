Whether it’s a business problem or a personal project that you are working on, a well-defined problem can save you a lot of time and trouble. The objective of a problem statement is to state the problem you are trying to solve clearly. If it is done well, it can be defined in a couple of sentences.

Remember your problem statement has to be SMART.

Specific: The problem statement has to be detailed and specific to the problem you are solving.
Measurable: Are there any metrics you can track so that you can tell if it is successful at the end of the project?
Action: What specific actions can you take to solve your problem?
Relevant: There are multiple ways to solve a problem but focus on the most relevant method.
Timebound: Have you added a time constraint to when your problem should be solved?

e.g. How can XYZ reduce their failure rates below 5% by the end of the year, through manufacturing and analysing product performance?

A problem statement that follows a SMART guideline will set you up on a successful track to meeting your end goal. More importantly, after you have finished the problem statement, you will have a much better idea of your project’s finer details.
